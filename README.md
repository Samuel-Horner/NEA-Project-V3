### NEA Project
This project was created for the coursework component of my A-Level computer science course.

To run the project, ensure you have Node.js installed (the project was built for v21.6.1 and I cannot garantee it will work on other versions) and run the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/Samuel-Horner/NEA-Project-V3
cd NEA-Project-V3
node server.js
```
and connect to the webiste at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). I have created an example account with
```
username = Example account
password = 12345678
```
which has an example project.
